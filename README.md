## Introduction

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a key area of natural language processing (NLP) that focuses on determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This project applies sentiment analysis to Arabic tweets, leveraging a Twitter corpus specifically tailored for this purpose.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of Arabic tweets that have been labeled for sentiment. The data is preprocessed to handle Arabic language specifics, including tokenization, stemming, and normalization.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Tokenization:** Breaking down sentences into individual words or tokens.
- **Stemming/Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their base or root form.
- **Normalization:** Handling variations in Arabic script, such as different forms of the same letter.


## Features

- **Sentiment Classification:** The model classifies Arabic tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Customized preprocessing for Arabic text, including handling of special characters and Arabic diacritics.
- **Model Evaluation:** Includes performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following packages:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your chosen model)


Based on the provided file, I'll create a README.md template that you can use to document your project. Since I can't directly open the file, I'll create a generic template that you can modify to fit the specific details of your project.
